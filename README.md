## ðŸ”„ How It Works (Business Logic)

### The Basic Flow:
1. **User signs up** â†’ Creates account with email/password
2. **User finds organization** â†’ Browses list of available organizations  
3. **User requests to join** â†’ Clicks "Join" and writes optional message
4. **Admin gets notification** â†’ Sees pending request in Admin Panel
5. **Admin decides** â†’ Approves or rejects the request
6. **User gets access** â†’ Can now see organization's projects and content

### What Each Role Can Do:

** Employee (Basic Member):**
- View organization page and members
- See all projects in the organization
- Cannot create new projects
- Cannot manage other people

** Manager:**
- Everything Employee can do, PLUS:
- Create new projects
- Edit projects they created
- Mark projects as complete

** Admin:**
- Everything Manager can do, PLUS:
- Approve/reject membership requests
- Change anyone's role (promote Employee to Manager, etc.)
- Edit organization details
- Remove ymployees/members from organization
